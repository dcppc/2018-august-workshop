### Interview questions with Rebecca Calisi

Interview questions (Bonus points for brevity!)

1. We’re nearing the end of phase 1. What unexpected things have emerged? What surprises have there been?
1. What should be the goals of the next phase of the pilot?
1. How do you see the Data Commons actually working with respect to partnerships, adding new data sets, adding new features, and so on? What problems do you expect to crop up?
1. How do you think the Data Commons will affect biomedical researchers, in a practical day-to-day sense? For example, how will R01s change? How will publishing change? How will tenure/promotions change? Will this make more or less work for researchers?


### C4 Meeting: August 29, 2018
